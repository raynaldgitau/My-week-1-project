# My-week-1-project
## DESCRIPTION
Here is a codde of a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade as follows: 

A > 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 59 to 49, D > 40 to 49, E > less 40.

Assuming that the students scores are,(Sonya', 90, 'Davi', 75, 'Sebastian', 64, 'Selo', 45, 'Mantix', 28)
the average total becomes '60.4' which is worth a B grade.

You can change the values to obtain their average and the grade.

## PROJECT SETUP
Given a function I need to return text that sent the letter grade corresponding to the given score. If the given score is greater than 100 or less than 0, it should return Invalid. 
(>79)--->A 
(>60)--->B 
(>59)--->C 
(>49)--->D
(<40)--->E
respectively
